# StyleDecor - Frontend (Vite + React)

This is a mock frontend scaffold for the **StyleDecor** project (Smart Home & Ceremony Decoration Booking System).

## Features included
- Vite + React
- Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI
- Swiper (hero carousel)
- react-hot-toast
- React Router pages (Home, Services, ServiceDetails, Booking, Dashboard)
- Placeholder assets and components

## How to use
1. Unzip the project.
2. `cd styleddecor-frontend`
3. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install`
4. Start the dev server:
   - `npm run dev`
5. Build:
   - `npm run build`

## Notes
- This is a frontend scaffold (mock). No backend included.
- Replace placeholder images and complete auth/Stripe/backend integration per the project spec.
- Make sure to add environment variables in a `.env` as required for APIs or Firebase.

Good luck finishing the rest of the project — you can use this scaffold to implement the full features (auth, payments, JWT tokens, admin flows).
